About
---

The Media Feed Project is an effort to create a definitive list of RSS/Atom feeds from news organizations. These are organized as follows:

* Print
* Television
* Internet-only
* Radio

Feed types supported as a minimum are as follows:
* [Atom](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287)
* [RSS 2.0](https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html)
* [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org/)

Feeds are organized by news organization (for example, The New York Times) (see our [News Organization page](https://github.com/mediafeedproject/mediafeedproject/blob/master/news_organizations.md), and all feeds from that organzation are stored in a file in Outline Processor Markup Language (OPML). The lists should be in subscription list format (see the [OPML spec](http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html#subscriptionLists) for details).
